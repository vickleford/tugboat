Tugboat
=======

Tugboat is a continuous integration/continuous delivery tool to log into 
puppetmasters and agents to run config updates after an automated deploy with
another tool such as Flagship.

Setup
-----

For sysadmins:

    * Install tugboat
        python setup.py install
    
    * Configure tugboat (see Configuration below for multiple profiles)
        vim tugboat/config.ini
        
    * Run tugboat
        tugboat --environments [ ENVIRONMENTS ...] --projects [ PROJECTS ...] 
    
For developers:

    * Clone the repository
        git@github.com:vickleford/tugboat.git
        
    * Create a virtualenv
        virtualenv tugboat
        cd tugboat
    
    * Set up the project in developer mode:
        python setup.py develop
        
    * Run tugboat
        tugboat --environments [ ENVIRONMENTS ...] --projects [ PROJECTS ...] 
    
Configuration
-------------

Tugboat is supplied with a sample INI configuration at tugboat/config.ini.

Ideally, you want to set up a puppetmaster and specify more sections that match
environment names set up on your puppetmaster. For example, if you have
environments /etc/puppet/environments/prod, /etc/puppet/environments/staging,
you want to set up a section for [prod] and [staging]. 

If you have multiple puppetmasters you need to work with, such as a production
and development puppetmaster, just add multiple configurations and invoke
tugboat with the -f flag to specify what configuration file you want to use.
